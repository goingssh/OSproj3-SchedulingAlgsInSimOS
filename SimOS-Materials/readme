use command "make" to compile.
use command "make clean" to remove compiled files.

run with "./osSIM #CPU" for basic FIFO scheduler on given # CPU's.

once implemented, add options to run your new scheduling algorithms
"-r time_slice" will use round-robin alg with given time_slice
"-p" will use static priority alg with priorities defined in proc.c

EXTRA CREDIT: "-m time_slice" will use multilevel feedback scheduling algorithm with given time_slice.
